# How to Clean Up Gmail

## or hero to zero

I had about 30,000+ unread emails in my gmail account. I went through last year and used a combo of searches to identify and remove/mark as read many of them, and got it back to a reasonable level.

Unfortunately, it's back at 3,000 a year later. Can I get to inbox zero?

This time I'm going to write down the steps and make it easier.

1. Start with the oldest stuff;

`older_than:12y is:unread` -- yep, this comes back with hundreds of matches

2. In that pile of stuff, look for emails from things that no longer have relevance

Examples:

`from: hostelworld.com` -- been a while since I travelled, even longer since I stayed in a hostel. Quick scan and 41 emails deleted.
`from: egg.com` -- now defunct online bank
`from: lastminute.com ` -- was a UK hotel discount place
`from: elance.com ` -- freelancer website

3. Ok slowly making progress, so lets see if we can focus on things that save quota

`has:attachment older_than:10y is:unread` -- really old things with attachment -- here noted that I send myself a lot of stuff, from other accounts.

`from: noreply & from: google.com ` -- alerts from various google stuff. I missed out on a class action against google plus.

I never wrote back, sorry Tom.

`from: myspace.com ` -- seriously, delete.

After about 30mins, or longer :( -- down to 1,500 unread emails.

`older_than:10y is:unread ` -- next step.

**1/27**

`from: store-news@amazon.com ` -- marketing from amazon (also unsubbed)

`from: @amazon.com -from: aws-receivables-support@email.amazon.com ` -- all order updates but not aws invoices

`from: audible.com | from: audible.co.uk ` -- nothing useful here long term -- delete

`from: airasia.com -"booking no:" ` -- all marketing stuff from air asia, but not my actual flights (cause it's nice to see where I went when)

`from: nominet.org.uk ` -- nothing since 2010

`from: skype.com ` -- nothing useful here, just missed stuff I saw later

`from: insideapple.apple.com ` -- so much, unsubbed and deleted

`from: no_reply@email.apple.com from: noreply@email.apple.com ` -- test flight and receipts - deleted

`from: email.apple.com ` -- should be safe, had a notification of support response

`from: apple.com -"order" -"receipt" -from: devbugs@apple.com ` filtered out everything, except orders, and updates on bugs I've filed.

`from: equitymaster.com ` -- how did I miss this one!

`from: no-reply-aws@amazon.com ` -- aws newsletters and updates

`from: twitter.com` -- nothing needed here

`from: <trading-website>.com -"trade confirmation" -"tax year 2020" ` -- none needed, but I do want notification of tax forms

`from: <important-person>@gmail.com | from: <other-important-person>@gmail.com ` -- mark as read

**1/28**

Done -- inbox zero!

How to keep it there;

1. make filters
2. unsubscribe
3. use `is:unread older_than:1w` regularly

Was on 30,000+ about a year ago, 3,000+ last week. Won't get there again.
