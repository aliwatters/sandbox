# Github Actions

Github recently (for me anyways) introduced actions that can do things like CI steps etc.

I need to understand the capabilities and how to use this; https://docs.github.com/en/actions

Goals:

1. run through the hello-world
2. see if I can make a skaffold branch where this can happen
3. submit a PR -- note what secrets are needed to make happen

https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/issues/5284 -- this is the issue to develop against.
