# Making Snaps

### A side quest

From: [Kubernetes and Skaffold Course Notes](../2020/docker-kubernetes-course/section-19.md)

As part of running through a kubernetes course, I started to setup a `skaffold` system. Unfotunately the `skaffold` snap image is out of date and I started to hit errors. This side quest is all about getting a new updated version of skaffold in a snap. But step 1, how do I build snaps.

## Creating a new snap.

https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-your-first-snap#2-getting-started

```
$ snap version
snap    2.48.2
snapd   2.48.2
series  16
ubuntu  20.04
kernel  5.4.0-60-generic
```

We're making a snap called -- `hello`

```
$ mkdir -p ~/mysnaps/hello
$ cd ~/mysnaps/hello
```

Next up -- `snapcraft`

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ sudo snap install snapcraft
[sudo] password for ali:
error: This revision of snap "snapcraft" was published using classic
       confinement and thus may perform arbitrary system changes outside of the
       security sandbox that snaps are usually confined to, which may put your
       system at risk.

       If you understand and want to proceed repeat the command including
       --classic.
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
snapcraft 4.4.4 from Canonical✓ installed
```

Now I've updated the `snapcraft.yml` file;

```
name: hello
base: core18
version: '2.10'
summary: GNU Hello, the "hello world" snap
description: |
  GNU hello prints a friendly greeting.

grade: devel
confinement: devmode

parts:
  gnu-hello:
    source: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.10.tar.gz
    plugin: autotools
```

This is next; has a node base, probably runs `npm i && npm start`. Here `autotools` runs `./configure && make && make install`

Now to build.

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ snapcraft
Support for 'multipass' needs to be set up. Would you like to do it now? [y/N]: y
snapd is not logged in, snap install commands will use sudo

Snapping |
Snapped hello_2.10_amd64.snap
```

At this point the snap is built. Now to install;

```
$ sudo snap install --devmode hello_2.10_amd64.snap
hello 2.10 installed
```

```
$ snap list hello
Name   Version  Rev  Tracking  Publisher  Notes
hello  2.10     x1   -         -          devmode

$ hello

Command 'hello' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo snap install hello              # version 2.10, or
sudo apt  install hello              # version 2.10-2ubuntu2
sudo apt  install hello-traditional  # version 2.10-5

See 'snap info hello' for additional versions.

$ snap info hello
name:      hello
summary:   GNU Hello, the "hello world" snap
publisher: –
store-url: https://snapcraft.io/hello
license:   unset
description: |
  GNU hello prints a friendly greeting.

```

So mine isn't working.

How do I run my devmode hello?

I have to define the command. This is added to `snapcraft.yaml`

```
apps:
  hello:
    command: bin/hello
```

Then rebuild; and shell into the "snap" to poke around.

```
$ snapcraft prime --shell

# New shell

$ ls stage/bin/
hello

$ ls prime/bin/
ls: cannot access 'prime/bin': No such file or directory

$ snapcraft prime
Pulling ....

# ... build info ...

make[1]: Leaving directory '/root/parts/gnu-hello/build'
Staging gnu-hello
Priming gnu-hello
```

```
$ sudo snap install --devmode hello_2.10_amd64.snap
error: cannot open: "hello_2.10_amd64.snap"
```

That command didn't work, but the file is in `prime/bin` now.

So I exited the VM and ran in the `snaps/hello` directory;

```
$ sudo snap install --devmode hello_2.10_amd64.snap
[sudo] password for ali:
hello 2.10 installed
```

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ hello
Hello, world!
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ which hello
/snap/bin/hello
```

Working!

Done. No.

Next up https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-your-first-snap#5-a-snap-is-made-of-parts

This is interesting;

> This time the command name is different from the snap name. By default, all commands are exposed to the user as <snap-name>.<command-name>. This binary will thus be hello.bash. That way, we will avoid a clash with /bin/bash (system binaries trump binaries shipped by snaps) or any other snaps shipping a bash command. However, as you may remember, the first binary is named hello. This is due to the simplification when equals . Instead of hello.hello, we have the command condensed to hello.

Which explains the `microk8s.<commands>` seen there.

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ snapcraft
# ... build output ...

ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ sudo snap install --devmode hello_2.10_amd64.snap
hello 2.10 installed

ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ hello
Hello, world!

ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ hello.bash

bash-4.3$ env
SSH_AGENT_PID=20505
GPG_AGENT_INFO=/run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent:0:1
# ...
```

Note: `env` in that shell had access to all my environment vars which included some _sensitive keys!_

These however are the interesting vars;

```
SNAP_ARCH=amd64
SNAP_COMMON=/var/snap/hello/common
SNAP_CONTEXT=hKE72Fn1hNqTv5thzjj-qe3YvoAajt100w7ALa0e_cb_gM-G4O37
SNAP_COOKIE=hKE72Fn1hNqTv5thzjj-qe3YvoAajt100w7ALa0e_cb_gM-G4O37
SNAP_DATA=/var/snap/hello/x3
SNAP_INSTANCE_KEY=
SNAP_INSTANCE_NAME=hello
SNAP_LIBRARY_PATH=/var/lib/snapd/lib/gl:/var/lib/snapd/lib/gl32:/var/lib/snapd/void
SNAP_NAME=hello
SNAP_REAL_HOME=/home/ali
SNAP_REEXEC=
SNAP_REVISION=x3
SNAP=/snap/hello/x3
SNAP_USER_COMMON=/home/ali/snap/hello/common
SNAP_USER_DATA=/home/ali/snap/hello/x3
SNAP_VERSION=2.10
```

Now; removing the dev tags and modes from our config, 'cause it's all tested and working and other folks want to use it.

`confinement: strict` -- change from `devmode` in the `snapcraft.yml`

Build and install.

```
$ sudo snap install hello_2.10_amd64.snap
error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap "hello_2.10_amd64.snap"
```

Not in the appstore so has no signatures -- seems fair enough!

`--dangerous` gets around that.

Next up, publishing my snap. Already have an `aliwatters` ubuntu account, signed in.

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ snapcraft login

```

Registering a snap.

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ snapcraft register aliwatters-hello

We always want to ensure that users get the software they expect
for a particular name.

If needed, we will rename snaps to ensure that a particular name
reflects the software most widely expected by our community.

For example, most people would expect 'thunderbird' to be published by
Mozilla. They would also expect to be able to get other snaps of
Thunderbird as '$username-thunderbird'.

Would you say that MOST users will expect 'aliwatters-hello' to come from
you, and be the software you intend to publish there? [y/N]: y
Registering aliwatters-hello.
Congrats! You are now the publisher of 'aliwatters-hello'.
```

Seems like squatters could cause hassle here! Hope canonical tidy up. Interestingly the tutorial suggests `<snapname>-<username>` where as `snapcraft` looks to prefer `<username>-<snapname>` (I went with that as a hunch).

Update `snapcraft.yml`

```
name: aliwatters-hello
grade: stable
```

Build and publish... should be;

```
$ snapcraft
# lots and lots of build info

$ sudo snap remove hello
# remove dev version

$ snapcraft push aliwatters-hello_2.10_amd64.snap --release=candidate
```

But -- it crashed at this point:

```
$ snapcraft

# ... build output

Run the same command again with --debug to shell into the environment if you wish to introspect this failure.

Not sure what to do to debug here.

Well -- I tried a few times and seemed to create a package at some point.

```

Let's publish.

Done.

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ sudo snap install --candidate aliwatters-hello
aliwatters-hello (candidate) 2.10 from Ali Watters (aliwatters) installed

ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ hello
bash: /snap/bin/hello: No such file or directory
```

Found it -- due to the `hello.hello` being condenced to `hello` -- `aliwatters-hello.hello` is the command.

```
ali@stinky:~/mysnaps/hello$ aliwatters-hello.hello
Hello, world!
```

Trying to name `hello` see if that fixes it.

So -- that gives;

```

## Stage 2 - update the skaffold snap to latest.

How hard can it be?
