# Udemy Learn and Understand AngularJS

Took this course as refresher on terminology and basics (I've been working in a big pre-architected monolithic SPA)

This is the course I wish I had taken when I was first learning - 5 star. It made a few of the "magic" steps super clear even at this stage, if it seems slow in the early stages - keep with it you'll really appreciate the clarity on the more difficult concetps.

You'll need to followup on the latest changes from 1.3 -> 1.4 -> 1.5

Nice work Anthony Alicea.
