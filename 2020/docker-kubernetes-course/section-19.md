## Section 19 -- local development with skaffold

https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/15271340

https://skaffold.dev/

Two modes:

1. rebuild the images on file changes
2. inject the files into the container

My installation: https://snapcraft.io/skaffold - there's a snap!

```
$ sudo snap install skaffold
skaffold v0.25.0 from dt9394 (terraform-snap) installed
```

Stephen is on v0.32.0, so we're a little bit behind on a latest/stable release.

Next create a `skaffold.yml` file in the root of the project. See the `dkc-mutli-k8s` project... urgh **mutli**. NOTE: `yml` not `yaml` ... so not consistent.

The `sync` option is very interesting, globs on the patterns to run in mode 2, INJECT the files. Changes to any other files are mode 1, REBUILD the image.

Ok the snap is too old, updating. Oh no, the snaps are really old, `0.26` is the latest.

Aside: I'm going to try and create a new snap.

```

Lots to debug there, but it's a holiday today (MLK) and I'm doing family stuff, so going to stop for now.
